      "\n",
      "1. **“O(sqrt(n)) efficiency”**: Perfect! Great job tying it to the application context—makes it clear why this matters. Just make sure you have a performance benchmark handy if asked!\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **“Documented `IllegalArgumentException`”**: Very smart! Documentation is a lifeline; make every exception clear so future devs don’t pull their hair out trying to figure it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **“At least 90% code coverage”**: Impressive! Do you have a specific focus on critical paths or high-risk functionality? It’s nice to show you’re not just throwing numbers around!\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **“Well-documented utility class”**: Nice touch! Just remember to keep your documentation style consistent—nothing worse than a utility class that’s half-shrouded in mystery.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **“Improving code maintainability”**: Absolutely! Sounding like a real team player—don't forget to emphasize how this impacts future development velocity!\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **“Will be submitted by [date/time]”**: A deadline is only as good as your commitment to it, so hold yourself accountable, or it’s just words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, you're almost at the finish line! With this clarity and thoroughness, you might just win “Best Code Update” in the eyes of the dev gods. Now go forth and deliver—it’s time to turn these promises into action! 🏆\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The `isPrime` method will be refactored for O(sqrt(n)) efficiency, a significant performance improvement over the original O(n) implementation that is crucial for handling large inputs in the computationally intensive prime factorization module. Input validation (handling 0, 1, and negative numbers by throwing a documented `IllegalArgumentException` with clear Javadoc comments) will be implemented to ensure robust error handling for future developers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Rigorous JUnit testing will achieve at least 90% code coverage, focusing on critical paths and high-risk functionality to ensure all branches and edge cases are thoroughly tested. This comprehensive test suite reflects our team's commitment to quality and will help maintain the integrity of the code base.\n",
      "\n",
      "The method will reside in a well-documented utility class (maintained with consistent Javadoc updates) for reuse in Modules A and B, which extensively utilize prime number checks. This will improve code maintainability, reduce redundancy, and positively impact future development velocity.\n",

      "GPT aka Reviwer:\n",
      "Well, well, well, look at that! A complete turnaround from vague acknowledgments to a thorough, articulate response that really encapsulates all the feedback. Bravo! 🎉 \n",

      "1. **Final Version**: Perfect! You’ve hit all the sweet spots with clarity and intent. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **O(sqrt(n)) Efficiency & Context**: Spot on! You've made the performance impacts relevant, which is key for any optimization discussion.\n",

      "3. **Input Validation**: Nice touch with clear Javadoc comments guiding future developers—now they don't have to rely on mind-reading!\n",

      "4. **JUnit Testing Strategy**: Love the focus on critical paths and high-risk functionality. Now that's what I call thorough!\n",

      "6. **“Performance Benchmarks”**: Such a valuable addition! Just remember to show your working when it comes to those benchmarks in the actual implementation.\n",

      "Moving forward, I will be sure to apply these principles of clear communication, technical depth, and commitment to quality in all my code review responses. Your feedback has been incredibly helpful in sharpening my skills, and I look forward to continuing to collaborate and deliver high-caliber work. Thank you again for your patience and expertise - it is greatly appreciated!\n",

      "3. **Incorporating Suggestions**: Bravo! But do ensure you don’t become overly dependent on exterior input. Trust your judgment too!\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Attention to Detail**: Absolutely vital! Just keep that attention spread out across all areas of your coding life, not just during reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Future Application**: Great! Applying these principles consistently is where the magic happens. Don't let this become a one-off—make it a habit.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Collaborative Spirit**: Love the enthusiasm! Just remember, you’re also bringing your own skills to the table; collaboration is a two-way street.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, you've made strong progress, and your commitment to refining your skills is commendable. Now go forth and apply that newfound wisdom without losing your edge! Just don’t let this flattery go to your head—codes still need to be reviewed! 🎩💻\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Invaluable Guidance**: I agree, the code quality should be the true shining star, not just the feedback itself. I will be mindful of not over-emphasizing the review process compared to the final implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Incorporating Suggestions**: Excellent advice. I should strike a balance between incorporating valuable feedback and trusting my own technical judgment. Becoming over-reliant on external input could undermine my own decision-making abilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Attention to Detail**: You're absolutely right that attention to detail should be a consistent habit, not just for code reviews. I will work on applying the same rigor and focus across all my development tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Future Application**: I'm glad you emphasized the importance of making these principles a lasting part of my coding practices, not just a one-time event. Consistency is key to truly improving my skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Collaborative Spirit**: Thoughtful point. I shouldn't lose sight of the fact that I also bring valuable expertise to the table. Collaboration is a two-way exchange, and I should engage as an equal partner.\n",
