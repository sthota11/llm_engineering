      "Yes, I can help you efficiently generate and find prime numbers in Java using various algorithms. One of the most efficient methods to find all prime numbers up to a given limit \\( n \\) is the **Sieve of Eratosthenes** algorithm. This algorithm is particularly efficient for generating a list of primes and works in \\( O(n \\log(\\log(n))) \\) time.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Sieve of Eratosthenes Implementation in Java\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s how you can implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes in Java:\n",
      "\n",
      "```java\n",
      "import java.util.Arrays;\n",
      "\n",
      "public class SieveOfEratosthenes {\n",
      "\n",
      "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
      "        int n = 100; // You can set this to any upper limit\n",
      "        boolean[] isPrime = sieveOfEratosthenes(n);\n",
      "        System.out.println(\"Prime numbers up to \" + n + \":\");\n",
      "        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n",
      "            if (isPrime[i]) {\n",
      "                System.out.print(i + \" \");\n",

      "        Arrays.fill(isPrime, true); // Assume all numbers are prime initially\n",
      "\n",
      "        isPrime[0] = false; // 0 is not prime\n",
      "        isPrime[1] = false; // 1 is not prime\n",
      "\n",
      "        for (int p = 2; p * p <= n; p++) {\n",
      "            // If isPrime[p] is not changed, then it is a prime\n",
      "            if (isPrime[p]) {\n",
      "                // Mark multiples of p as non-prime\n",
      "                for (int multiple = p * p; multiple <= n; multiple += p) {\n",

      "        }\n",
      "        return isPrime;\n",
      "    }\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initialization**: The code starts by creating a boolean array `isPrime` where `isPrime[i]` will be `true` if `i` is a prime number.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Marking Non-Primes**: We loop from `2` to `√n` and for each prime number `p`, we mark all its multiples greater than `p*p` as non-prime.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Output**: After processing the array, we print out all the indices that are still marked as `true`, which correspond to the prime numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Usage:\n",
      "\n",
      "- You can change the value of `n` in the `main` method to find all prime numbers up to any desired limit.\n",
      "- This implementation is space-efficient with a complexity of \\( O(n) \\) for space due to the boolean array.\n",
