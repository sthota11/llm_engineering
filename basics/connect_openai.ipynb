       "\n",
       "## Overview of Data\n",
       "\n",
       "The data includes weekly stock prices, and for each week we have:\n",
       "- **Opening Prices:** The price at which the stock opened at the beginning of the week.\n",
       "- **Closing Prices:** The price at which the stock closed at the end of the week.\n",
       "- **High Prices:** The highest price the stock reached during the week.\n",
       "- **Low Prices:** The lowest price the stock reached during the week.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Trends Observed\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Price Fluctuation:**\n",
       "   - Throughout the year, the stock prices have shown significant fluctuation, with noticeable increases and decreases week over week.\n",
       "   - For instance, the stock's price opened at **202.21** on Feb 3, 2025, indicating a higher level compared to weeks earlier in the data. The highest recorded price during the week was **208.70**.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Price Movement:**\n",
       "   - The stock price has generally trended upwards in the early parts of the year, reaching peaks of around **208.70** in early February.\n",
       "   - There were notable dips, for example, in late December 2024, where the price was reported as low as **170.49**.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Volume Changes:**\n",
       "   - The trading volume has varied significantly across the weeks, with some weeks reporting volumes in excess of **139 million** shares traded, reflecting either increased investor interest or volatility around certain events or announcements.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Dividends:**\n",
       "   - There were dividends paid out during this period, notably **0.20** on multiple occasions. This is an additional return to investors aside from the capital gains from price appreciation.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Total Returns Calculation\n",
       "\n",
       "To compute the total returns percentage over the time period:\n",
       "1. **Initial Price**:  The price from Feb 12, 2024 (the first recorded week in the data) where the stock closed at **141.76**.\n",
       "2. **Final Price**: The price from Feb 3, 2025, closing at **187.14**.\n",
       "3. **Dividend Returns**:  Calculate total dividends received:  **0.20 + 0.20 + 0.20 = 0.60** (paid three times).\n",

       "\\[\n",
       "\\text{Total Returns Percentage} = \\left(\\frac{187.14 + 0.60 - 141.76}{141.76}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx \\left(\\frac{46.98}{141.76}\\right) \\times 100 \\approx 33.13\\%\n",

       "\n",
       "The analysis indicates that Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has performed well over the observed period, yielding a favorable total return of approximately **33.13%**. The stock has shown substantial volatility, with highs and lows, making it a potentially exciting option for investors who can tolerate risk. The dividends add to the returns, making it attractive even beyond just price appreciation. \n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, despite the fluctuations and various macroeconomic factors that may influence stock prices, Alphabet Inc. remains a strong contender in the market."

      "To find prime numbers efficiently in Java, you can use several methods, each improving on the straightforward techniques. A prime number is defined as a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Understanding Prime Numbers**:\n",
      "   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. Examples include 2, 3, 5, 7, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Basic Methodology**:\n",
      "   - The simplest way to check if a number \\( n \\) is prime is to check if it is divisible by any number from 2 to \\( n-1 \\). However, this is inefficient for larger numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Optimized Solution: Trial Division**:\n",
      "   - **Check up to the Square Root**: You only need to check divisibility up to the square root of \\( n \\). If \\( n \\) is divisible by any number up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\), it cannot be prime.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Skipping Even Numbers**:\n",
      "   - After checking for divisibility by 2, you can skip all even numbers and check only the odd numbers starting from 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Implementation Example**:\n",
      "Here’s a Java implementation using these optimizations to find all prime numbers up to a given maximum number:\n",
      "\n",
      "```java\n",
      "import java.util.ArrayList;\n",

      "    }\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
      "- **findPrimes Method**: \n",
      "   - This method initializes a list to hold prime numbers and returns it after computation.\n",
      "   - It starts by adding 2, the only even prime.\n",
      "   - It then iterates through all odd numbers up to `max`, checking each for primality.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **isPrime Method**: \n",
      "   - This method checks if a number \\( n \\) is prime. \n",
      "   - First, it handles edge cases for numbers less than 2 and the even number 2.\n",
      "   - Then it checks for divisibility against all odd numbers up to the square root of \\( n \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. **Further Optimizations**:\n",
      "If you're interested in even more efficient methods:\n",
      "- **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: This is an algorithm that finds all primes up to a certain number \\( n \\) in a much more efficient manner by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime starting from 2.\n",

       "When solving for prime numbers in Java, the approach you choose depends on your specific requirements, such as the range of numbers and performance considerations. For generating a large list of primes, the Sieve of Eratosthenes is often the best choice, while the trial division method (especially the optimized version) is simple and effective for checking if individual numbers are prime."
